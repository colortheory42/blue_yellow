# 🟦🟨 Blue & Yellow Backrooms --- Pygame Engine

An experimental Backrooms-style exploration engine built with **Python +
Pygame**.\
This project focuses on atmosphere, color identity, and
procedural-feeling spaces rather than traditional enemies or combat.

The experience is built around immersion, navigation, and psychological
expectation --- not action gameplay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎮 Concept

**Blue & Yellow Backrooms** is a minimal, atmospheric exploration
environment where the player navigates repeating geometry and surreal
color spaces.

Instead of entities, danger comes from: - Disorientation\
- Spatial repetition\
- Pattern recognition failure\
- Player expectations not matching reality

Survival means maintaining orientation and continuing forward through
uncertainty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

-   No traditional enemies required
-   Environment is the main character
-   Color identity is intentional (blue/yellow contrast theme)
-   Repetition is a feature, not a bug
-   Player curiosity drives movement
-   Each run can feel slightly different depending on navigation choices

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-   Python 3
-   Pygame
-   Numpy (optional)
-   Fullscreen rendering
-   Experimental pseudo‑3D / ray-style rendering

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 How to Run

Install dependencies:

    pip install pygame numpy

Run:

    python main.py

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Player Goal

There is no score system by default.

Success is defined by: - Exploration time - Distance traveled - Pattern
recognition - Personal interpretation of progress

Optional future goals may include: - Area markers - Zone transitions -
Memory-based navigation - Tape logs / run records

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧭 Controls

Typical controls:

-   W / S --- Move forward / backward\
-   A / D --- Strafe left / right\
-   Mouse --- Look around\
-   ESC --- Exit

(Edit this section if your control scheme changes.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📼 Build Identity

This project is part of an evolving Backrooms engine experiment.\
Different builds may be labeled as:

-   Tape builds
-   Engine revisions
-   Level identity versions

Example:

Tape_91 --- Blue & Yellow Official Build

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔮 Planned Ideas

-   AI auto-explorer mode
-   Procedural layout seeds
-   Environmental storytelling
-   Wall markings / air painting
-   Player path prediction system
-   Replayable run logs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Status

Active experimental engine focused on atmosphere and perception testing.
